## The EZbakR-suite

### Summary

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-8}
- Introduced Snakemake pipeline ([fastq2EZbakR](https://github.com/isaacvock/fastq2EZbakR)) and R package ([EZbakR](https://github.com/isaacvock/EZbakR))
- Generalizes feature assignment: the set of annotated genomic features that you can perform analyses on.
- Generalizes mixture modeling: how the fraction of reads from labeled RNA are estimated.
- Generalizes dynamical systems modeling: how kinetic parameters are estimated from NR-seq data.
- Generalizes comparative analyses: how kinetic parameters are compared across biological conditions.

## bakR

### Summary

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-8}

- Introduced an R package ([bakR](https://github.com/simonlabcode/bakR)) designed to compare RNA synthesis and degradation
rate constants across biological conditions.
- Also introduced a hierarchical modeling strategy to increase statistical power of
these comparisons.
