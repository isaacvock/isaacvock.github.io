I am a post-doc at Stanford University in the lab of Anshul Kundaje. I am currently working on developing sequence-to-function models, with a particular focus on models that will help us dissect the mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation.

In my PhD, I developed a number of bioinformatic tools for processing and analyzing nucleotide recoding RNA-seq (NR-seq) experiments. NR-seq is a class of methods for quantifying the kinetics of RNA synthesis and degradation, and includes methods like [TimeLapse-seq](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4582) (developed in the Simon lab), [SLAM-seq](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4435), [TUC-seq](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31768978/), etc. These are powerful tools that are allowing us to study the dynamic lives of RNA at unprecedented resolution, and I have had a lot of fun dreaming up ways in which we can extract exciting biological insights from NR-seq data.

I am also a statistician, and have developed a number of novel methods for analyzing NR-seq data. One of my passions is helping biologists better understand the statistical methods powering their favorite bioinformatic tools. This led me to develop a course at Yale called "Statistical Intuition for Modern (RNA) Biochemists", which ran as part of the 2023-2024 cohort of the [Associates in Teaching Program](https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/teaching/teaching-programs-and-events/associates-in-teaching). I taught the course in the Spring of 2025; course evals can be found [here](https://coursetable.com/catalog?course-modal=202501-22751). It was inspired by Susan Holmes and Wolfgang Huber's book of a [similar title](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/) and Richard McCelreath's cultural phenomenon ["Statistical Rethinking"](https://xcelab.net/rm/). I wanted the course to be an accessible introduction to statistics for biochemistry majors. We covered the basic machinery of statistical modeling and its use in popular methods like linear modeling and clustering. Rather than relying on mathematical formalism to convey these concepts though, the course made use of simulations and interactive exercises to help students develop an intuition for key concepts. Finally, the course started by introducing student's to RNA-seq, so as to establish a common data language that we could connect all concepts back to. All of the course material is hosted at [this repo](https://github.com/isaacvock/Statistical_Intuition_Material).
